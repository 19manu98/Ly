# Lyrics Finder

A program that returns the lyrics to the given song title.

## Usage
Assuming `/path/to/ly.py` is `$PWD/ly.py` and `python3` is installed, run the following

```bash
$ python3 ly.py song_tile
```

## Feature: error tolerance

### Scenario 0 : *yeah, the song title is..*

```bash 
$ python3 ly.py the man who sold the world
```

### Output

Nirvana - The Man Who Sold The World

We passed upon the stair
... [lyrics continues]

Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

... [lyrics continues]
```

```bash 
$ python3 ly.py the woman who sailed the world
```

### Output

Nirvana - The Man Who Sold The World

We passed upon the stair
... [lyrics continues]

Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

... [lyrics continues]
```

## Tips

Use `python3 ly.py` with Unix's `less` command ðŸ‘»

### Approach 0
in `$HOME/.alias` (alias file [sourced](http://www.theunixschool.com/2012/04/what-is-sourcing-file.html) in my `$HOME/.bashrc`), I added

```bash
function ly() {
	python3 /path/to/ly.py $@ | less
}
```
### Approach 1
Alternatively I could have done the following

1. Make `ly.py` executable with `chmod 7xx /path/to/ly.py`

2. Add `#!/usr/bin/env python3` as the first line of code in `ly.py`.

3. Create a symbolic link to `ly.py` in a path that exists in the env. variable`$PATH`. (`$HOME/.local/bin` recommended).

3.0. assuming `$HOME/.local/bin` is in `$PATH`. **verify by running**
   
```bash 
$ echo $PATH | grep -e "[$HOME|~]/.local/bin" --color=always
```
   **if there is match, skip to 3.1** else run the following first
   
```bash 
$ mkdir -p $HOME/.local/bin && echo "export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
```
3.1. Create the symlink by running
   
```bash 
$ ln -sf "/path/to/ly.py" "$HOME/.local/bin/ly"`
```
### Result

Regardless of the chosen approach, `ly.py` can be executed as

```bash
$ ly song_title
```

### [lyf](https://github.com/tati-z/.dotfiles/blob/9095247f54d12280a3118600d65598ee78191ab9/.alias#L62)

Lyf helpes ly.py only outputs 15 lines of the lyrics test starting 3 lines above occurence of $keyword then 12 lines away if available.

e.g: here the keyword **beautiful** is used.

```bash
$ lyf beautiful black pearl
```

#### results

```bash

Uh huh... uh huh... ooh...

I know someday you'll have a beautiful life,
I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky,
But why, why, why can't it be, can't it be mine?

Aah... uuh..

Too doo doo too, too doo doo [many times until fade]


```
