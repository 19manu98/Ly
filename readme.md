## Tips

Use `ly.py` with Unix's `less` command ðŸ‘» using the following bash function.
```bash
function ly() {
	python3 /path/to/ly.py $@ | less
}
```
### Result

```bash
$ ly song_title
```

Use  Unix's `grep` with [lyf](https://github.com/tati-z/.dotfiles/blob/9095247f54d12280a3118600d65598ee78191ab9/.alias#L62) to only output the lyrics surrounding a given keyword.

e.g: I only want the lyrics surrounding the keyword **beautiful** in _Pearl Jam's Black_.

```bash
$ lyf beautiful black pearl
```

#### Result

```

Uh huh... uh huh... ooh...

I know someday you'll have a beautiful life,
I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky,
But why, why, why can't it be, can't it be mine?

Aah... uuh..

Too doo doo too, too doo doo [many times until fade]


```
